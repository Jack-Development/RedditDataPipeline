# RedditFetch

RedditFetch is a robust and efficient tool for collecting and managing datasets from Reddit. This repository is designed to fetch posts and comments from specified Reddit users, assign unique IDs to users, and save the data in a structured manner.

Inspired by the vast amount of data available on Reddit and the need for a streamlined data collection process, this project was developed to provide a seamless experience for researchers and developers interested in Reddit data.

The initial implementation focuses on user-specific data collection, but the modular architecture of the codebase allows for potential expansion to other Reddit data types.

## Skills and Technologies Used

The project heavily relies on:

- Python
- PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
- JSON
